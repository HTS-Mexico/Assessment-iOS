## Welcome to the iOS Engineer Assessment!

We are glad to know that you are here ü•≥ <br/>
In this step is time to show us what you got!

### Objective

The goal of this assessment is to create a simple iOS Application that displays a list of the available Pok√©mon from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.com/) service. <br/>
Each Pok√©mon on the list should be able to have a single view to show more details about each one. <br/>
Consider the case of no internet connection, to only show the local data we got the last time we used the app. <br/>
To successfully complete this assessment, you will need to implement a good design pattern and follow design principles.

### Instructions

- Design the application's UI, ensuring it follows design principles and is easy to use. This will involve designing a list view to display items.
- Use a good design pattern to organize your codebase. This will involve creating separate classes and functions for different features of your application.
- Test your application thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning as expected. This will involve checking the internet connection, details of single Pok√©mon, and that the application is visually appealing and easy to use.
- Optimize the performance of your application to ensure that it runs smoothly on a range of iPhone devices.
- Update the [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) file with a little guide on how to run the app or any special considerations such as third-party dependencies.

### Requirements

- User interface
  - **Main view** (named Pok√©dex)
    - Search input for the user to enter a Pok√©mon id or name.
    - Single display area for the list of all the Pok√©mon
  - **Detail view** (to show the details of a Pok√©mon)
    - Image container
    - Container to show the id and name of the Pok√©mon
    - Preferred clean template to reveal details of a Pok√©mon
    - Available only if there is an active internet connection
- Functionality
  - Implement the functionality to fetch a list of Pok√©mon, the data should be paginated with a page size of 15 items per request; when the user reaches the end of the list, the app should request the next page of the list
  - Display the results of the Pok√©mon list on the display area inside the main view
  - Implement the functionality to fetch the data of a single Pok√©mon
  - When the user selects a Pok√©mon from the list of the **main view**, the app should change to the detail view with the information about them
  - The **detail view** show should have a back button to show again the list of all the Pok√©mon
  - When the user writes a valid id or name of Pok√©mon on the search bar and presses the enter key on the keyboard, the app should show the detailed view of the Pok√©mon; emulating that the user has selected it from the main list.
  - If there is no internet connection, the app should show the last list of Pok√©mon we got the last time we used the app
  - If there is no internet connection, the app should disable the option to show the details of a single Pok√©mon
- Presenting information
  - [**Main View**] Each item of the list should display:
    - Name of Pok√©mon
    - Id of Pok√©mon
    - Image of Pok√©mon (nice to have)
  - [**Detail view**] The detail view for a single Pok√©mon should display:
    - Image of Pok√©mon
    - Id
    - Name
    - Abilities
    - Type
    - Height
    - Weight
    - Health
    - Attack
    - Defense
    - Special attack
    - Special defense
    - Speed
- Error handling
  - Implement error handling to manage incorrect Pok√©mon id, Pok√©mon name, or any API errors

- Pok√©mon image could be found it on the Pok√©mon data model

  ```JSON
